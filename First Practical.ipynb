    "### Theory\n",
    "**Uninformed Search** algorithms, also known as blind search, do not have additional information about states beyond that provided in the problem definition. These methods explore the search space without knowledge of the goal's location. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a typical uninformed search technique that explores the graph level by level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informed Search** algorithms utilize heuristics to estimate the cost of a solution path and are more efficient than uninformed strategies. A* Search is one of the most popular informed search algorithms. It uses a heuristic function to guide itself towards the goal state more efficiently by evaluating paths based on their cost and estimated cost to reach the goal."
