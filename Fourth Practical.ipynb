    "Inference in Bayesian Networks involves calculating the posterior probabilities of a set of query variables given some observed evidence. This task is fundamental in many applications where decisions must be made under uncertainty. Bayesian inference uses the network structure and the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) to compute the likelihood of outcomes."
