    "The minimax algorithm is a recursive or backtracking algorithm used in decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. As its name suggests, the minimax algorithm seeks to minimize the maximum possible loss. In the context of games like Tic-Tac-Toe, it involves players taking turns to maximize their chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical setting where two players play the game, one player is considered the maximizer, and the other is the minimizer. Each player evaluates the game board's state to determine the outcome of possible moves and chooses the strategy that either maximizes their advantage or minimizes their losses depending on their role."

    "The minimax algorithm effectively makes optimal decisions in zero-sum games like Tic-Tac-Toe, where one player's gain is equivalent to another's loss. By simulating all possible moves in the game and their outcomes, the algorithm can decide the best possible move that leads to a win or a draw, preventing losses when played optimally."
